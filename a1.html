        While using red LEDs, I started with 5V output and my desired current for each LED is around 20 mA.
        To calculate the appropriate resistor value, I used Ohm's Law R = V / I.
        R = (5 V - 1.8 V) / 20 mA = 160 Ω, meaning that the resistor should be at least greater than 160 Ω,
        so I picked a 220 Ω resistor as it's the closest resistor I have and still keeps the LED with a decent brightness.

        I wired 3 red LEDs in parallel, each with its own 220 Ω resistor, all connected back to the same ground.

          <strong><li>Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.</li></strong>

          <p>
            In my for loop, I programmed the LEDs to light up sequentially in the order of pin 3, pin 7, and pin 10.
            I used a delay of 1000 ms to keep each LED on for one second, followed by another 1000 ms delay while it stays off.
            Therefore, each LED alternates between 0 V (off) and 5 V (on) for 1000 ms at a time, blinking one after another.
            LED 3 first, then LED 7, then LED 10, repeating every 6000 ms.

          <strong><li>How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?</li></strong>
          <p>
            The Arduino Uno has 14 digital pins, along with 6 analog pins, giving a total of 20 possible connections for LEDs to blink independently.
            Since the LEDs are wired in parallel, the overall current draw would just be the sum of the current through each LED.
            Assuming using red LEDs with a forward voltage of 1.8 V and 220 Ω resistors for all LEDs: the current for each LED is (5.0 V - 1.8 V) / 220 Ω ≈ 14.5 mA.
            With 20 available pins, the total current is 20 * 14.5 mA, which is approximately 290 mA.

          <strong><li>How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?</li></strong>
          <p>If you set the delay to be under 4ms, running the blink function would be hard to tell if it's blinking or just lighted up at all times.</p>
