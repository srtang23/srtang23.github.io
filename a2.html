      <h2>Schematic</h2>

      <p>
        This circuit uses a pushbutton to control an RGB LED through the Arduino.
        The pushbutton is connected to 5V power and pin 2, with a 10k Ω resistor connected to ground.
        The RGB LED is wired so that each color (red, green, and blue)
        is connected to a different pin on the Arduino (pins 11, 10, and 9).
        Each color also has its own resistor to limit current: 220 Ω for red and green,
        and 100 Ω for blue to make the brightness more balanced. The RGB LED shares the same ground with the pushbutton.
      </p>
      <h3>Resistor Calculation and Choices</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>LEDs - </strong> With a 5 V supply and a desired current of 20 mA,
            and given that red and green LEDs both have a voltage drop of 1.8 V,
            and blue LED with a higher voltage drop of 3.3 V:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Red LED:  R = (5 V - 1.8 V) / 20 mA = 160 Ω</li>
            <li>Green LED:  R = (5 V - 1.8 V) / 20 mA = 160 Ω</li>
            <li>Blue LED:  R = (5 V - 3.3 V) / 20 mA = 85 Ω</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            So I chose a 220 Ω resistor for the red and green LEDs,
            and a 100 Ω resistor for the blue LED, as these were the closest available values.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Pushbutton - </strong> I chose a 10k Ω resistor for the pushbutton
            because it's in the middle range of typical resistor values,
            providing just enough current to keep the input pin from floating
            and prevent it from randomly picking up signals or charges from the air.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>I = 5 V / 10k Ω = 0.5 mA</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

          <strong><li>
            Draw a chart where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage.
            Draw 3 lines representing the voltage across an LED with analogWrite(led, 64), analogWrite(led, 128), and analogWrite(led, 255).
          </li></strong>
          <p>
            Assuming a red LED with a forward voltage of approximately 1.8 V,
            the graph shows how the voltage across the LED changes with different duty cycles:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><code class="inline-code">analogWrite(64)</code> -> about 25% duty cycle (25% on, 75% off)</li>
            <li><code class="inline-code">analogWrite(128)</code> -> about 50% duty cycle (50% on, 50% off)</li>
            <li><code class="inline-code">analogWrite(255)</code> -> 100% duty cycle(100% on)</li>

          <strong><li>
            Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing that draws current is your LEDs,
            how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200 mAh battery?
          </li></strong>
          <p>
            Since the RGB LEDs in my circuit are wired in parallel, the overall current draw is the sum of the current through each LED.
            However, because I used a single RGB LED, only one color or a fading sequence runs at a time.
          <ul>
            <li>Assuming we're using the red light: (5 V - 1.8 V) / 220 Ω ≈ 14.5 mA</li>
            <li>With a 1200 mAh battery: 1200 mAh / 14.5 mA ≈ <strong>82.8 hrs</strong></li>
          </ul>

        </div>

        <div>
          <strong><li>
            Measure and record the actual voltage across one of your LEDs when it's on.
            How does this compare to the theoretical forward voltage for your LED color?
          </li></strong>
          <p>
            I measured the actual voltage of the red pin using a multimeter,
            and it's around 1.868 V, which is very close to the theoretical forward voltage of 1.8 V for a red LED.

            I didn't use AI for any context of this assignment but
            I used cursor.ai to help with the styling of the website.
            Prompt: "help with the styling of this website,
            adjust images to resonable sizing,
            better layout,
            use clean colors without changing any content in the website".
            I also used ChatGPT and cursor.ai to help debug as the styling wasn't updated on GitHub Pages.
