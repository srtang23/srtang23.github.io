      <p>
        This circuit uses a pushbutton to control an RGB LED through the Arduino.
        The pushbutton is connected to 5V power and pin 2, with a 10k Ω resistor connected to ground.
        The RGB LED is wired so that each color (red, green, and blue)
        is connected to a different pin on the Arduino (pins 11, 10, and 9).
        Each color also has its own resistor to limit current: 220 Ω for red and green,
        and 100 Ω for blue to make the brightness more balanced. The RGB LED shares the same ground with the pushbutton.
      </p>
      <h3>Calculation for resistors</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>LEDs - </strong> With a 5 V supply and a desired current of 20 mA,
            and given that red and green LEDs both have a voltage drop of 1.8 V,
            and blue LED with a higher voltage drop of 3.3 V:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Red LED:  R = (5 V - 1.8 V) / 20 mA = 160 Ω</li>
            <li>Green LED:  R = (5 V - 1.8 V) / 20 mA = 160 Ω</li>
            <li>Blue LED:  R = (5 V - 3.3 V) / 20 mA = 85 Ω</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            So I chose a 220 Ω resistor for the red and green LEDs,
            and a 100 Ω resistor for the blue LED, as these were the closest available values.

            Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing that draws current is your LEDs,
            how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200 mAh battery?

            Measure and record the actual voltage across one of your LEDs when it's on.
            How does this compare to the theoretical forward voltage for your LED color?
