        This schematic shows how the Arduino is connected to the keypad and LCD for my password-based lock system.
        The 4x3 keypad connects its rows to pins 7, 6, A0, and A1, and its columns to pins A2-A4,
        leaving out the unused C4 column from the keypad (so it's 4x3).
        The 16x2 LCD is wired in 4-bit mode, with D4-D7 going to pins 2-5,
        and RS and E connected to pins 12 and 11.
        The V0 pin has a 2k Ω resistor connected to ground to adjust text brightness,
        and a 220 Ω resistor is used between the LCD's backlight anode and 5 V to limit current
        and control the backlight. Everything shares the same 5 V and ground.
        The values of the resistors were chosen by testing with different resistor ranges,
        and these two provided the best results for display contrast and backlight brightness.

          This circuit shows the full wiring setup of Arduino for my password-based lock system.
          The 4x3 keypad on the left is connected to digital pins A0-A4 and pins 6-7 on the Arduino,
          which are used to detect key presses. The 16x2 LCD on the right is wired to digital pins 2-5,
          11, and 12 using the LiquidCrystal setup. A 10 kΩ potentiometer adjusts the screen contrast,
          and a 220 Ω resistor controls the backlight brightness. The keypad acts as the input for entering the password,
          while the LCD acts as an output that provides live feedback, including showing prompts,
          asterisks for entered digits, and countdown messages during the lockout period.

        This project uses the <code>LiquidCrystal</code> and <code>Keypad</code>
        libraries to replicate a password-based lock system.
        The LCD prompts “ENTER PASSWORD” and waits for # to start.
        After entering the 4-digit code, it checks whether it matches the preset password;
        if not, you have up to three tries before the system locks for 10 seconds,
        displaying a countdown on the screen before resetting the failed attempts.

          <strong><li>
            Say you are using a servo motor you attach to pin 9. In your loop() you have the following code:
            <pre><code>
void loop() {
for (pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos += 1) {
  myservo.write(pos);
  delay(100);
  }
}
          </code></pre>
          Draw a graph with the x-axis as time and the y-axis as voltage at pin 9 with respect to ground.
          </li></strong>
          <img src="images/voltage_time_graph_a4.jpeg" class="graph">
          <p>
            The signal is a pulse train repeating every 20 ms (50 Hz),
            with each pulse briefly rising to 5 V before dropping back to 0 V.
            The pulse width varies between 1 ms and 2 ms, corresponding to the servo's position:
            about 0° at 1 ms, 90° at 1.5 ms (center), and 180° at 2 ms.
            Within the first 80 ms shown,
            the pulse widens slightly from 1 ms to about 1.2 ms (it would be hard to tell the difference in the graph).

            Your input device is slightly broken, leading it to give us an erroneous reading 1% of the time.
            How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.
          </li></strong>
          <pre><code>
Initialize count to 0
Initialize an integer array readings that can hold 10 values

While count is less than 10:
  Take a new reading from the input device and append it to readings
  Increment count by 1

Sort readings from smallest to largest
Compute the median by getting reading[count/2]

Return the median

For each int reading in readings:
  Take a new reading from the input device and store it as currInput
