    <h1>A3: Input Output</h1>

      <h2>Schematic</h2>

      <p>
        This circuit uses a voltage divider with a fixed resistor R1 and a photoresistor R2 to sense
        and control the brightness of an RGB LED through the Arduino.
        The V-measure is connected to the Arduino's analog input at A0.
        As light intensity changes, this voltage also changes between 0 V and 5 V
        since the circuit is powered by a 5 V input.
        The RGB LED, with red, green, and blue pins, is connected to three PWM pins (11, 10, 9)
        on the Arduino, allowing each color's brightness to be independently controlled.
        The circuit shares a common ground between the LED and the voltage divider.

      <h3>Resistor Calculation and Choices</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>LEDs - </strong> With a 5 V supply and a desired current of 20 mA,
            and given that red and green LEDs both have a voltage drop of 1.8 V,
            and blue LED with a higher voltage drop of 3.3 V:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Red LED:  R = (5 V - 1.8 V) / 20 mA = 160 Ω</li>
            <li>Green LED:  R = (5 V - 1.8 V) / 20 mA = 160 Ω</li>
            <li>Blue LED:  R = (5 V - 3.3 V) / 20 mA = 85 Ω</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            So I chose a 220 Ω resistor for the red and green LEDs,
            and a 100 Ω resistor for the blue LED, as these were the closest available values.

            <strong>Fixed Resistor for voltage divider - </strong>
            When I measured my photoresistor with a multimeter,
            its resistance was around 15k Ω under natural lighting.
            To choose the fixed resistor R1 for my voltage divider,
            I selected a 10k Ω resistor, which is in the same range
            as the resistance of my photoresistor.
          </p>

      <h2>Circuit</h2>
      <div class="circuit-images">
        <img src="images/circuit_a3.png">
        <p>
          The RGB LED is connected to Arduino PWM pins 11, 10, and 9 for color control,
          while a voltage divider using a 10k Ω fixed resistor and a photoresistor
          connects to analog pin A0 to measure light intensity.
        </p>
      </div>

      <img src="images/circuit_operation_a3.GIF">
      <p>
        The RGB LED cycles through red, green, and blue, each staying on for about two seconds.
        As I hover my hand over the photoresistor, it blocks light, increasing its resistance
        and raising V-measure closer to 5 V, which makes the LED appear brighter.
        When I move my hand away, more light hits the sensor, the resistance drops, and the LED dims.
        This pattern repeats for each color.

      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <ol>
        <div>
          <strong><li>
            In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 or does it need to be one or the other?
            Justify your answer with example calculations.
          </li></strong>
          <p>
            Yes, the variable resistor can be either R1 or R2.
            For a voltage divider, V_out = V_in * R2/(R1+R2).
            If the variable is R1, increasing R1 decreases V_out, and decreasing R1 increases V_out;
            If the variable is R2, increasing R2 increases V_out, and decreasing R2 decreases V_out.
            Assuming V_in = 5 V, the fixed resistor = 10k Ω, the variable resistor ranges from 1k to 10k Ω:
            <ol>
              <li>
                R2 is the variable resistor, R1 = 10k Ω fixed:
                <ul>
                  <li>R2 = 1k Ω -> V_out ≈ 0.45 V</li>
                  <li>R2 = 5k Ω -> V_out ≈ 1.67 V</li>
                  <li>R2 = 10k Ω -> V_out ≈ 2.5 V</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                R1 is the variable resistor, R2 = 10k Ω fixed:
                <ul>
                  <li>R1 = 1k Ω -> V_out ≈ 4.55 V</li>
                  <li>R1 = 5k Ω -> V_out ≈ 3.33 V</li>
                  <li>R1 = 10k Ω -> V_out ≈ 2.5 V</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <strong><li>
            Draw a graph where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is voltage.
            Plot the voltage at V-measure of your voltage divider of your shared gif.
          </li></strong>
          <p>
            The voltage divider in my circuit uses a fixed resistor as R1 and a photoresistor as R2.
            As a result, increasing R2 increases V_out, and decreasing R2 decreases V_out.
            When the photoresistor is exposed to bright light, its resistance decreases, causing V-measure to drop.
            In my shared GIF, when I hover my hand and block the light,
            the resistance of the photoresistor increases, making V-measure rise closer to 5 V
            (since I used a 5 V power input).
            This change happens every two-second interval for each LED color change in my code.

          <strong><li>
            AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values.
            Imagine you had 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead.
            How would this change your map() code? Explain your answer.
          </li></strong>
          <p>
            If the system uses a 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter,
            I'd need to adjust the parameter values in my <code class="inline-code">map()</code> function.
            A 10-bit PWM can output from 0 to 1,023 instead of 0 to 255,
            A 16-bit analog-to-digital converter reads values from 0 to 65,535 instead of 0 to 1023.
            So the same sensor voltage range that used to be 400-800 would now be scaled up by 64
            (since 65,536 / 1,024 = 64), becoming roughly 25,600-51,200.
            The new line of code would look like <code class="inline-code">map(sensorValue, 25600, 51200, 0, 1023)</code>.
